## Core Application Structure

This repository has the function of serving as a main skeleton from which
an application project can be initiated. It contains features that are
specific to this author's approach to development (like pytest with coverage
 and strict options for TDD, a template for setup.py, the use of \_\_main__.py 
 along with argparser for CLI, etc) but can be adapted for anyone else's needs 
 with some basic tweaking.

My use of this repository consists of cloning its contents into a local
directory, making the necessary modifications, commiting and then pushing it
 upstream with the new project into its specific repository.
