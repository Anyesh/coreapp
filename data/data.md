# Data Files

Use this markdown file to describe the type of data that is stored in each of
 the other files included in this subdirectory.

> Having this subdirectory is helpful for testing. It’s a central location for 
>any files that your application will ingest or produce. Depending on how you 
>deploy your application, you can keep “production-level” inputs and outputs 
>pointed to this directory, or only use it for internal testing.
