# Documentation

A few words on how the "core" module works. Each new module should have its
 documentation included in its own "module.md" file.
 
 > With a more advanced application, youâ€™ll want to maintain good
> documentation of all its parts. Put any documentation for internal modules
> here, which is why you see a document for the core package. If
> you use docstrings in your internal modules (and you should!), 
>your whole-module documentation should at the very least give a holistic view 
>of the purpose and function of the module.
